# Ideal Body Weight Calculator
You have been tasked with creating an app which calculates ideal body weight. The program is required to do the following:

    • Given a users weight, height and gender the program calculates there ideal body weight (IBW) and indicates whether the user is over or above their IBW.
    • The user should be able to enter their weight in pounds or kilograms and the program converts it appropriately based on the formula.
    • The user should be able to enter their height in cms or inches and the program converts it appropriately based on the formula.

You will need to make use of the following formula to calculate ideal body weight:
Males: IBW = 50kg + 2.3kg for each inch over 5 feet
Females: IBW = 45.5kg + 2.3kg for each inch over 5 feet

Please note there are 2.2 pounds in a kg and 2.54cms in an inch and 12 inches in a foot.

In addition, the following functionality has been identified as desirable and should be implemented where possible:

    • Present the user with a list of appropriate recommendations to enable them to either increase their weight or reduce their weight to enable them to hit their ideal body weight.
    • Stores user details and track their ideal body weight over time.
